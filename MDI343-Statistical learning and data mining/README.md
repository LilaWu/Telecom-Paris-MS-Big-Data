# MDI343-Statistical learning and data mining

Many modern applications such as web data, genomics, finance, e-marketing need to hangling and processing very large data.

The discipline taht develops and studies concrete methods for modeling this type of data is called statistical machine learning.

Ultimately, it is about producting prediction and decision support tools dedicated to a specific application. 

The appearance of very powerful algorithms for the calssification of large-scale data, such as boosting or Support Vector Machines in the mid-90s, gradually replaced the traditional statitics which relied largely on the manual preprocessing.

Based on theory popularized by Vapnik (The Natural of Statistical Learning, 1995), a new research stram was born: it links the mathematical and computer communities and mobilizes a growing number of young researchers turned towards big data analysis.

In this course, I got deeper understanding of this domain, it's fondations, the problems it addresses (supervised and unsupervised problems), and the most recent methods that are currently being studied (SVM, Boosting, Lasso, etc.).

The interest of these concepts and techniques will be illustrated through concerte applications, like textual data, images, audio signals, genomic data, industrial problems, etc.
